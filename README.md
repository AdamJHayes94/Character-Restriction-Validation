# Character-Restriction-Validation
This is a javascript file I created that validation the checkout to not accept special characters

The javascript file reads the input of the text boxes and then validates using regualr expressions.
If an input is not accepted by the regular expression then when the customer clicks off the text box, it will automatically remove the banned characters.

The local.xml file shows what I added to the local.xml file to make sure that the javascript file was only used on the checkout.

Note that both these files are not in their own file structure.
